Hill-Climbing Key Recovery for ML-DSA via Verification Fitness Oracle
(Noisy Leakage Model)

Variant of the deterministic v8 attack adapted for the noisy leakage setting
(Damm et al., Section 6, Definition 7).  The leaked bit y_j is independently
flipped with error rate p (the --noise-level parameter), modelling realistic
side-channel noise.

Key adaptations for the noisy model:

  1. Noise injection:  Each leaked bit y_j is flipped with probability p.

  2. Outlier rejection:  After relation extraction, samples with
     |z_bar| > 2^{j-1} + beta are discarded.  These arise from
     noise-corrupted leak bits (Theorem 9) and fall outside the
     valid range for both correct and flipped extractions.

  3. Count (L0) fitness only:  F(x) = number of violated verification
     equations.  The excess (L1) metric is unsuitable because noise-
     corrupted relations produce errors of ~2*beta that dominate the
     sum and mislead the optimizer.

  4. OLS rescaling:  The regression warm start is rescaled by
     r = 1/(1-2p) to correct the bias E[x_hat] = (1-2p)*x
     (Theorem 12, Algorithm 3 of Damm et al.).

  5. Tuned defaults:  Hyperparameters adjusted for the harder noisy
     regime (higher patience values).

Optional MOSEK ILP fallback (--mosek) (currently disabled):
  When hill climbing converges (best-ever stagnation exceeds --patience), the best
  intermediate solution x' is handed to MOSEK's mixed-integer optimizer as a
  warm start for an Integer Linear Program.  The ILP encodes the verification
  relations as hard constraints and minimises the L1 distance to x'.

  Requires the MOSEK Python package (``pip install Mosek``) and a valid license.

Optional Gurobi ILP fallback (--gurobi) (currently disabled):
  Alternative ILP fallback using Gurobi as a pure feasibility solver (no
  objective function).  The hill-climbing estimate x' is injected via Gurobi's
  VarHintVal mechanism, which guides both heuristics and branching decisions
  throughout the MIP search.

  Requires the gurobipy package (``pip install gurobipy``) and a valid license.

Termination model:
  In the noisy regime, the true key violates some constraints (due to residual
  noise-corrupted relations), so F=0 is not a meaningful target.  The algorithm
  terminates when the global best-ever solution has not improved for --patience
  iterations (default: 10000), then returns that best-ever solution.  Iterated
  Local Search (ILS) perturbation is always active to prevent the optimizer from
  getting stuck in local optima induced by corrupted constraints.  The
  perturbation parameters --perturb-strength, --perturb-patience, and
  --perturb-max control ILS behaviour.  Note: only improvements to the global
  best-ever fitness reset the patience counter; ILS perturbations and local
  improvements that do not beat the best-ever do not reset it.

Optional optimization strategies (independently toggleable):

  Tier 1 -- Score-guided sampling (--score-guided):
    Uses regression residuals to bias position selection toward uncertain
    positions, dramatically increasing the hit rate on wrong positions.

  Tier 2 -- Adaptive block size / VNS (--adaptive-w):
    Variable Neighborhood Search: increases w when stuck, resets on progress.

  Tier 3a -- Accept lateral moves (--lateral-moves):
    Accepts F' == F to drift along plateaus.

  Tier 3b -- Frequency-based diversification (--diversify):
    Biases selection toward under-explored positions; periodic forced sweeps
    guarantee full coverage.

  Tier 4 -- w=1 sweep preamble (--sequential-w):
    Before each adaptive search phase, performs a batch parallel sweep over
    all n positions at block size w=1.  Positions are tested independently
    against a frozen snapshot of the current solution, then all improving
    changes are applied simultaneously.  Each full sweep counts as one
    iteration.  The sweep repeats until no further single-position
    improvements exist, then transitions to adaptive block search.

  --all-optimizations: Enables all of the above.
  --default-optimizations: Enables all except score-guided (recommended).

Graceful interruption:
  Ctrl+C during execution will finish the current iteration, then print
  summary statistics for all keys processed so far and write partial CSV
  output if --output was specified.  Ctrl+C also interrupts an active MOSEK
  solve gracefully via Model.breakSolver() or an active Gurobi solve via
  Model.terminate().

    In the noisy model (Definition 7), each leaked bit y_j is independently
    flipped with probability p = noise_level.  After relation extraction,

    Evaluates all candidates encoded in *candidates_i32T* against the

    of the best one.

    Memory-bounded evaluation:  The naive approach materialises an
    ``(R, K)`` matrix (``R`` relations, ``K`` candidates) whose
    intermediate arrays (int32 inner products, int64 residuals and
    temporaries, bool violation mask) peak at roughly 30 bytes per

    can far exceed available RAM -- e.g. ML-DSA-65 (eta=4) at w=4
    gives K = 9^4 = 6561; with R = 2 x 10^6 relations the
    intermediates alone would require > 350 GiB.

    When the estimated peak exceeds ``_CANDIDATE_EVAL_MEMORY_BUDGET``
    the evaluation is split into column-wise (candidate-wise) chunks
    that each stay within the budget.  A running argmin tracks the best
    candidate across chunks, producing results identical to the unchunked

    Attempt exact key recovery by solving an Integer Linear Program (ILP)
    encoding the verification relations as hard constraints.

    The ILP remains useful when noise is low enough that the true key
    satisfies the vast majority of constraints.

  Fitness uses count (L0) only.  Outlier rejection discards relations
  with |z_bar| > 2^{j-1} + beta.  OLS warm start is rescaled by
  r = 1/(1-2p) to correct the bias E[x_hat] = (1-2p)*x.

Optimization strategies:
  --score-guided      Tier 1: Bias position sampling toward uncertain positions
  --adaptive-w        Tier 2: VNS -- expand block size when stuck
  --lateral-moves     Tier 3a: Accept ties to drift along plateaus
  --diversify         Tier 3b: Penalise frequently selected positions
  --sequential-w      Tier 4: w=1 sweep preamble before adaptive search
  --all-optimizations Enable all of the above
  --default-optimizations  Enable all except score-guided (recommended)

ILS perturbation (always active):
  Perturbation restarts are always enabled in the noisy model to prevent
  the optimizer from getting stuck.  Use --perturb-strength, --perturb-patience,
  and --perturb-max to tune behaviour.

MOSEK ILP fallback (currently disabled):
  --mosek             On failure, attempt exact recovery via MOSEK ILP
  --mosek-timeout N   Solver time limit in seconds (default: 300)

Gurobi ILP fallback (currently disabled):
  --gurobi                   On failure, attempt recovery via Gurobi ILP
  --gurobi-timeout N         Solver time limit in seconds (default: 300)
  --gurobi-norel-time N      No-relaxation heuristic budget (default: 0)
  --gurobi-solution-limit K  Find up to K solutions (default: 1)
